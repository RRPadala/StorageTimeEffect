The storage time effect (as described here: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02032-0) is a measure of the gene expression changes in blood samples that have been left outside at room temperature. 
The purpose of this code is to use the gene signature provided by Massoni-Badosa et. al. and the UCell scoring system to find traces of the storage time effect in publicly available databases. 
The database used here is a curated version (https://stemangiola.github.io/CuratedAtlasQueryR/) of the CellxGene database (https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/). It also tries to correct any storage time effect if found and analyse the consequences of the correction.
